# Vue Storefront 2 integration for Orckestra Commerce Platform

------


## Requirements

- Node 16+
- Yarn

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Orckestra/orc-vsf
```

2. Install all required dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

3. Create `.env `file and set up variables (find `.env.example` and specify your values)
```sh
OVERTURE_URL=
OVERTURE_AUTH_TOKEN=
OVERTURE_SCOPE_NAME=
OVERTURE_INVENTORY_LOCATION_IDS=
SECRET_PASSPHRASE=
MEDIA_SERVER_URL=
MEDIA_FOLDER=
```

For security purpose, it is important to configure `SECRET_PASSPHRASE` which  is used to encrypt user tokens.

4. Build:

```sh
yarn build
```

5. If everything built properly, you can start working on your new frontend with:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Changing some parts of the code (notably the `api-client`) will trigger a re-build but the change will not be hot-reloaded. To ensure that the app sees you changes, re-run either `yarn build` or `yarn dev`.
